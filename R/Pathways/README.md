# MS1943
Script associated with the paper "Discovery of a first-in-class EZH2 selective degrader"

We produced RNA-seq data for 4 samples ( MDA-MD-468 breast cancer cell lines): 2 under DMSO and 2 under MS1943 degrader.


3. Enrichment Pathways

We next performed gene set enrichment analysis that capture pathways perturbed towards both directions simultaneously using the 24,448 ranked genes identified in our dataset and annotated in ENSEMBL (version 94) against the KEGG pathways using R GAGE (version 2.28.2) and Pathview (version 1.18.2) libraries8 and the hallmarks gene set collection (MSigDB V6.2) using GSEA.
